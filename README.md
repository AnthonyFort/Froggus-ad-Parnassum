# Froggus-ad-Parnassum

## Introduction

This was my first ever project, undertaken and completed in the 4th week of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (August 2023). The brief was to recreate a classic grid-based game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and to render it in the browser. I recreated Frogger (1981), but added a twist so that it doubles up as a musical improvisation training tool. This was a solo project. 

In classic Frogger, the aim of the game is to move one frog from one end of the grid to the other, avoiding obstacles along the way. In Froggus ad Parnassum, the player moves two frogs at the same time, one with each hand, not only avoiding obstacles (sharks), but ensuring that the frogs remain specific widths apart, according to certain rules. In doing so, the player achieves two things. Firstly, by playing with two hands at once, the player simulates playing a piano. In fact, I assigned each key a musical note so that the player does indeed produce musical sound. Secondly, by maintaining an appropriate width between frogs, the resulting musical harmony abides (with one caveat) by certain rules laid out in Johann Joseph Fux’s famous compositional treatise ‘Gradus ad Parnassum’ (1725).
