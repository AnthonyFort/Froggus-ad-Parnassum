        <div id="about-content" class="nav-content">Musical improvisation requires quick thinking, but learning how to think quickly takes hard work and isn’t always fun. Wouldn’t it be great if we could gamify the training process? Look no further! Froggus ad Parnassum combines the rigour of Johann Joseph Fux’s famous classical music textbook “Gradus ad Parnassum” (1725) with all the enjoyment of the 1981 hit arcade game Frogger. Train your music theory by moving the frogs across the river, and hone your quick-thinking abilities by racing the clock and getting a high score!</div>

        <div id="aim-content" class="nav-content" aria-label="Learn about the aim of the game.">The aim of the game is to move two frogs across the river to the lily pads on the other side, controlling one frog with your left hand, and one with your right. Each turn, the frogs will automatically move one square upwards, and it’s your job to decide where each will sit on the next row by selecting from the keys in the key guide shown above the grid. To be a valid move you must: 1) avoid the sharks; 2) hold both keys down at the same time; 3) make sure that the width between the frogs is valid, according to certain rules laid out in the rules section below.

          <ul>
            <li>The game begins by pressing ‘d’ with your left hand and semicolon (‘;’) with your right.</li>
            <li>After that, for the middle rows, the width between the frogs must span either 3 or 6 keys. For example, if you press ‘f’ with your left hand, the options for your right hand are ‘h’ or ‘l’.</li>
            <li>On ONE occasion, if you want, frogs are allowed to span either 5 or 8 keys in these middle rows.</li>
            <li>In the last two rows, you must move the frogs onto the lily pads.</li>
            <li>Remember, you must hold down both keys at once for the move to be valid.</li>
